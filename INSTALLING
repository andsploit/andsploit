drozer Installation
===================

To get drozer running you will need:

 * a PC
 * an Android device or emulator, running Android 2.1 (Eclair) or later

To get the most from drozer, your system will need a number of packages installed:

 * Java
 * Android Software Development Kit (SDK)

You should ensure that each of these is on your system path (you should be able
to execute adb and java).

Then, follow the instructions for your platform.

If you run anti-virus software on your system, it is recommended to exclude the
directory that you will install drozer into. Otherwise, parts of the
exploitation tools may be detected and removed.

Note: before upgrading, you should remove all previous version of drozer or
      Mercury from your system. This will avoid potential problems with drozer
      using parts of the old codebase.


Windows
-------

A Windows Installer is available for drozer, which builds a complete Python
environment on your PC with most of drozer's dependencies built in.

Before you start, make sure that you have the Java JDK installed, and your
JAVA_HOME environment variable points to this folder.

The drozer installation must be run as a Windows administrator.

To test the installation:

 > C:\drozer\drozer.bat
 usage: drozer [COMMAND]


Linux
-----

Download the latest version of drozer from the project site (mwr.to/drozer),
these contain a Python .egg file to install drozer.

First, you need to install drozer's dependencies, which should be available in
your distributions package repository.

 * Python 2.7 with development headers
 * Python Setuptools
 * ia-32libs (if you have a 64-bit system)

Then, as root, install drozer's Python dependencies:

 $ easy_install --allow-hosts pypi.python.org protobuf==2.4.1
 $ easy_install twisted==10.2.0

Next, as root, install drozer itself:

 $ easy_install ./drozer-2.3.0-py2.7.egg

It is recommended to double check the file permissions of the bundled aapt
executable. This is typically installed to:

  /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/drozer-<version>-py2.7.egg/
    drozer/lib/aapt

It should have 755 permissions.

To test the installation:

 $ drozer
 usage: drozer [COMMAND]

 $

Congratulations, you are ready to go.


Bash Completion
---------------

drozer support Bash Completion on Linux.

To enable this, create a file in /etc/bash_completion.d/drozer that contains:

    _drozer()
    {
        local cur prev opts
        COMPREPLY=()
        cur="${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}"
        prev="${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD-1]}"

        opts=`/path/to/drozer-complete ${COMP_WORDS[@]} $COMP_CWORD 2> /dev/null`

        COMPREPLY=( $(compgen -W "${opts}" -- ${cur}) )
        return 0
    }
    complete -F _drozer drozer

Then run:

    $ . /etc/bash_completion
