andsploit Installation
===================

To get andsploit running you will need:

 * a PC
 * an Android device or emulator, running Android 2.1 (Eclair) or later

To get the most from andsploit, your system will need a number of packages installed:

 * Java
 * Android Software Development Kit (SDK)

You should ensure that each of these is on your system path (you should be able
to execute adb and java).

Then, follow the instructions for your platform.

If you run anti-virus software on your system, it is recommended to exclude the
directory that you will install andsploit into. Otherwise, parts of the
exploitation tools may be detected and removed.

Note: before upgrading, you should remove all previous version of andsploit or
      Mercury from your system. This will avoid potential problems with andsploit
      using parts of the old codebase.


Windows
-------

A Windows Installer is available for andsploit, which builds a complete Python
environment on your PC with most of andsploit's dependencies built in.

Before you start, make sure that you have the Java JDK installed, and your
JAVA_HOME environment variable points to this folder.

The andsploit installation must be run as a Windows administrator.

To test the installation:

 > C:\andsploit\andsploit.bat
 usage: andsploit [COMMAND]


Linux
-----

Download the latest version of andsploit from the project site (mwr.to/andsploit),
these contain a Python .egg file to install andsploit.

First, you need to install andsploit's dependencies, which should be available in
your distributions package repository.

 * Python 2.7 with development headers
 * Python Setuptools
 * ia-32libs (if you have a 64-bit system)

Then, as root, install andsploit's Python dependencies:

 $ easy_install --allow-hosts pypi.python.org protobuf==2.4.1
 $ easy_install twisted==10.2.0

Next, as root, install andsploit itself:

 $ easy_install ./andsploit-2.3.0-py2.7.egg

It is recommended to double check the file permissions of the bundled aapt
executable. This is typically installed to:

  /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/andsploit-<version>-py2.7.egg/
    andsploit/lib/aapt

It should have 755 permissions.

To test the installation:

 $ andsploit
 usage: andsploit [COMMAND]

 $

Congratulations, you are ready to go.


Bash Completion
---------------

andsploit support Bash Completion on Linux.

To enable this, create a file in /etc/bash_completion.d/andsploit that contains:

    _andsploit()
    {
        local cur prev opts
        COMPREPLY=()
        cur="${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}"
        prev="${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD-1]}"

        opts=`/path/to/andsploit-complete ${COMP_WORDS[@]} $COMP_CWORD 2> /dev/null`

        COMPREPLY=( $(compgen -W "${opts}" -- ${cur}) )
        return 0
    }
    complete -F _andsploit andsploit

Then run:

    $ . /etc/bash_completion
